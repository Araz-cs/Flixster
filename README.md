# Flix
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

I enjoyed creating the Flix application. I did a similar app with codepath team during class time and it helped me understand the aproach one needs to take to succeed in making an app.

### Notes
I encountered miner challanges which took some time from me to find out what I did wrong. I learned to take my time and do every step patiently and make sure every step works before jumping to the next step.
